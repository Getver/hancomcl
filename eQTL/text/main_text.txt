HeQT DB (Halym expression quantitative trait loci database) is constructed based on genotype and phenotype (expression, RNA-seq) data derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). This DB provides researchers with a search function using gene or SNP id to explore specific eQTL information. Additionally, it offers selective data querying based on metformin (a diabetes treatment drug) administration status and the presence of diabetic retinopathy (DR).
The DB consists exclusively of a Korean population cohort, with all data obtained from the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH). Researchers can leverage this DB to gain additional insights into specific variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as to explore eQTLs and genes that have greater effects on relevant traits.

Furthermore, this DB is designed to provide various biological and genetic information, supporting a wide range of research including GWAS follow-up studies, precision medicine, and personalized therapy development.
