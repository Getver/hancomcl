CHR	The chromosome where the SNP or gene is located. DNA is packaged into chromosomes that contain genetic material.
BP	The base pair position on the chromosome (hg38 reference genome).
SNP	Reference SNP ID (rsID) for the variant tested in the eQTL analysis.
REF	The allele present in the reference genome at this position.
ALT	The variant allele observed at this position, differing from the reference.
GENE	The gene whose expression is tested for association with the SNP.
DISTANCE	Distance between the SNP and the transcription start site (TSS) of the associated gene. Can be 0 if within the gene.
SLOPE	Effect size (regression coefficient) showing how the SNP allele affects gene expression.
p-value	Significance of the SNP-gene expression association. Lower values indicate stronger evidence.
FDR	Adjusted p-value accounting for multiple testing (False Discovery Rate).
VIEW	Links/icons to external webpages for the SNP or gene.
